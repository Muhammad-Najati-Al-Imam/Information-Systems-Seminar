Human Occupancy Detection & Activity Recognition
#
**Summary**
###
A research paper.
####
The goal is to build a Neural Network model that detects human occupancy inside households based on Watt usage (electricity consumption) and other features derived from it.
#
**Assignment Description**
###
Detecting when a household is occupied and which energy-related actions its resident are performing is fundamental to providing recommendations on reduction of energy consumption. Some activities may have inflexible schedules, such as cooking, unlike other activities, such as laundering, which may have schedules that are more flexible.
###
The paper is expected to provide a dive deep into the recent and well-established techniques on occupancy detection and activity recognition within a Smart Home context. In the empirical part, you will apply the thoroughly selected methodology on occupancy detection and activity recognition using real-world data. You could consider replicating the research in Stankovic et al (2016) and comparing the results with those from selected state-of-the-art techniques. 


The peer teams may consult your group for sharing some expertise within the human activity recognition area.
